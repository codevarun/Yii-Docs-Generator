Yii-Docs-Generator:

Generates nice HTML documentation from your Yii app source code, just a quick hack of the doc builder from Yii's build process.

Read the wiki at http://www.yiiframework.com/wiki/186/how-to-generate-yii-like-documentation/

Installation:

Extract the contents of the commands folder to protected/commands

Usage:

./yiic docs check - Checks the source code to see if there's any classes that are lacking documentation, good for quality checking

./yiic docs ../docs - Generates the site documentation in the specified folder (which must exist)

Documenting Views:

If you want to annotate the parameters passed to views by controllers, use the following syntax in your view right at the top of your view file
/**
  * Some text describing what the view does goes here
  * @uses CActiveDataProvider $dataProvider The data provider for this model
  * @uses User $model The user model
  */


Notes:

If you're getting errors with certain classes you might need to exclude them from the documentation process, to do this add them to the list of excluded files in $this->$appOptions in DocsCommand.php
