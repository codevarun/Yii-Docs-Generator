Yii-Docs-Generator

Generates nice HTML documentation from your Yii app source code, just a quick hack of the doc builder from Yii's build process.

Installation

Extract the contents of the commands folder to protected/commands

Usage

./yiic docs check - Checks the source code to see if there's any classes that are lacking documentation, good for quality checking

./yiic docs ../docs - Generates the site documentation in the specified folder (which must exist)


Notes:

If you're getting errors with certain classes you might need to exclude them from the documentation process, to do this add them to the list of excluded files in $this->$appOptions in DocsCommand.php
